  <h1>About Whazorz</h1>
  <p>My name is Edmunds, and I am passionate about art and everything related to creativity. In 2012, I began my career in technical fields, gradually moving toward graphic design while also live-streaming my creative process and sharing my ideas with others.

  <h3>Education Experience</h3>
  <p>
    During my secondary education, I started developing my artistic identity under the pseudonym “Whazorz.” Over the years, I have gained extensive technical experience in digital graphics, working on design and post-production projects for a variety of clients.

  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <p>I have solid experience working with computers, developing and planning graphic designs tailored to each client’s needs. Within my creative work, I am able to efficiently analyze incoming information, develop project concepts, and deliver complete visual solutions—from the initial idea to the final result. My focus is always on ensuring that the outcome meets client expectations while visually emphasizing the essence of the project.
