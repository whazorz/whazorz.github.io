Commission Terms & Conditions

Approval:
All design requests are subject to review and approval by the designer. Projects will only proceed if they meet the designer’s creative and technical requirements. The designer reserves the right to decline any request that does not align with the project criteria or ethical guidelines.

Payment:
Payment will be processed only after the client has reviewed and approved the proposed design. Please note that final pricing may vary depending on the project’s complexity and may exceed the initial estimate. Clients will be notified and must approve any cost adjustments before further work continues.

Timeframe:
The standard delivery timeframe is 2–3 business days. However, more complex or customized projects may require additional time. Clients will be informed of any expected delays in advance.

Revisions:
Each project includes up to two (2) revisions, depending on the scope and complexity. Additional revisions may incur extra charges, which will be discussed prior to implementation.

Communication:
All communication and project updates will be conducted via email to ensure clear and traceable correspondence. Clients are encouraged to respond promptly to maintain project timelines.

European Consumer Compliance:
All transactions comply with EU consumer protection laws, including transparency in pricing, digital service delivery, and refund eligibility. Once a design is approved and production has begun, refunds may not be available due to the custom nature of the service.
